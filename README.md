# TrappedKnight
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGQe8waGJ4w. 

This project is based on the aformentioned youtube video. Was the video mentioned, the knight would get trapped at 2084th square. I read youtube comment that
I thought was intersting. It asked "if that square were to be marked as visited beforehand, would the knight get trapped again, or would it hop indefinetly?". 

This project answers that question. It turns out that the knight does get trapped again at 2720, then 3325, then 3753... It also encounters double traps where 
the knight has to move back 2 squares to be able to find a "untrapped" pathway. This program prints out the first 100 traps. The whole program takes about 6-7 
seconds.

Cheers!
